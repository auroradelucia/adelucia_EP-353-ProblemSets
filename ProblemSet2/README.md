###Project Name
Problem Set 2

### Submitted by
Aurora De Lucia

###For Course
EP-353

###Due Date
2/09/2020

###Submission Date
2/10/2020

###Files Included
README.md
Problem2.1.c
Problem2.2.c
Problem2.3.c

###Purpose
The purpose was to understand more about integers, floats, and beginning math in programming

###Description
####Problem 2.1
Making sure we know how to do new lines and indentation, to have things print in a very specific way.

####Problem 2.2
Learning how to make it so that the print functions print integers so that if I change them in the integer variables, they change in the print function as well. (Learning %d, mainly)

####Problem 2.3
Learning about precision and making it so that certain decimal places show, also using new variable types (like float) instead of just integer.

###Build and Run Commands
Compiled teach problem set with clang


```clang Problem2.1.c  ```

```clang Problem2.2.c  ```

```clang Problem2.3.c  ```


and ran each one succesffully using the same command -


``` ./a.out ```
 
For problem set 1, it just printed what I asked in the visual way I wanted it printed

For problem set 2, it printed the pitch, velocity, and channels of MIDI notes - including the changed velocity

For problem set 3, it printed the frequency and decibel level of the sine tone - to the desired decimal place I asked
