###Files Included
README.md
Problem3.1.c
Problem3.2.c
Problem3.3.c

###Purpose
The purpose was to understand more about math and swtiches and a for loop.

###Description
####Problem 3.1
This was basically doing a math equation - specifically taking something to a power [so, pow()]. It was about making sure the frequency is correct for whatever MIDI note you put in. 

####Problem 3.2
More than anything, this was about learning to switch - having certain integers respond to notes.  

####Problem 3.3
This was building on the switch with a for loop, that loops through each integer outlined in the commannd.

###Build and Run Commands
Compiled teach problem set with clang


```clang Problem3.1.c  ```

```clang Problem3.2.c  ```

```clang Problem3.3.c  ```


and ran each one succesffully using the same command -


``` ./a.out ```
 
For problem set 1, it successfully printed the frequency of a MIDI note. (I tried it with a few different notes, to be sure the math equation worked.)

For problem set 2, it assigned MIDI notes based on integers.

For problem set 3, it had a loop that not only assigned integers, but went through an entire loop of them in one command.
