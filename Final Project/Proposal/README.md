### What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Aurora's Reverb

### In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "My project is about creating a web-based synthesizer.")

Building a reverb

### In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Building an algorithmic reverb. The user will be able to control the parameters like decay time, and size. Then it will change an audio file to add reverb to it at the command line. 

### If you are planning to combine EP-353's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to EP-353, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

not combining with any other class 

### In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome is having working reverb. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome is having a number of features defined by the user. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome is user-defined features, and more control of how much reverb is added to the original song/audio file (E.g. dry/wet.)

### In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?

A first step would be to learn how to do a delay, and research a bit about reverb and how to make it and change it.
