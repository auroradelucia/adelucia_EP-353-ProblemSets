### Aurora's Reverb

Okay, so I know this supposed to be several paragraphs. However, it's really pretty straightforward, but I'll try to overexplain, a bit.

Basically, this is a take on your original reverb code that I've modified and expanded. So, the first thing you're gonna wanna do is take a file and put it in the same folder "AurorasReverb.c" is in.

***You also must make sure that LPF.c is in the same folder, because it is used in AurorasReverb.c***

For demonstration purposes, I've put in CheeseSynth.wav, because the changes are fairly obvious when it spits out the new version of that file. 

I also added "ToxicTest.wav" which is just Britney Spears' Toxic, as a test, so you can see the reverb more on a whole song rather than a snippet. 

If you would like to try your own file, please make sure it's a mono (not stereo) file, and rthat it's a .wav.

(If you forget or don't see any of the instructions in this documentation, you'll be reminded in the terminal when you go to run it.)

So, you'll navigate to your folder in the terminal, as usual. Assuming you're not moving folders around, everything you need should be available in the "Final Project" folder available in my GitHub
